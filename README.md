# smartstring
A string class that automatically handles resurce allocation and deallocation (without smart pointers), move semantics are also implemented. 
Works like a smart_pointer (refcounting, move, etc.). 
The purpose of the project was to get more acquainted with the inner workings of the smart pointers (so i manually implemented them to undertsand them better) 
and the new features of c++11.
